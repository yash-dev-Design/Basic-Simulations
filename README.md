# Console-Based Mini Projects – C & Java (Practice-Based) 🧪💻

A collection of console-based applications built using C and Java for learning, practice, and concept reinforcement. These projects cover real-world systems like ATMs, hospitals, payroll, and shopping carts — focusing on core programming logic, file handling, and structured code design.

## 📦 Projects Overview

### 🔐 ATM Simulator (C Language)
- Simulates basic ATM functionalities: balance inquiry, deposit, withdrawal
- File handling for transaction history
- PIN authentication and simple user interface

### 🏥 Hospital Management System (Java)
- Admin dashboard to manage patients, doctors, treatments, and billing
- Object-Oriented design with modular Java classes
- Admission/discharge logic with input validation

### 👷 Employee Payroll System (C Language)
- Manages employee details, salary calculation, tax deduction
- Structured data using `struct`
- Generates payslip-like output in the console

### 🛒 Shopping Trolley App (C Language)
- Console-based cart with product selection, price calculations
- Quantity handling and total cost display
- Menu-driven program structure
- item-list, maincode, merge code were the files, dont get confused

## 💡 Learning Goals

- Strengthen logic building and conditional flows
- Gain hands-on experience with file I/O and data structures
- Practice real-time system design using procedural and OOP concepts
- Reinforce language fundamentals in both **C** and **Java**
